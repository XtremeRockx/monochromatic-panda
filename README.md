# Bradly's YouTube Downloader
Google Chrome Extension for Downloading YouTube Videos

## Introduction

Download YouTube videos without pain. Inserts a dropdown button with links to directly download the current video from YouTube in multiple formats. Easily integrates with the UI and does not interfere or rely on third party resources.  

As of December 20th, 2015, Google removed the extension from their web store. 

If there are any issues, please do not hesitate to create an issue here on Github so that I can fix it! Always follow this repository for any updates as I do sincerely try to update this as I can.

## Usage

Go to a video on YouTube, click the Download button, and click on a format that you desire. The download will begin and come directly from YouTube's servers.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this extension was to allow for users to easily and safely download YouTube videos. There were already extensions and websites available that allowed for the downloading of YouTube videos but they came at a great cost in convenience or safety. None of them did it without taking your information, inserting advertisements into the page, or trying to insert malware into your computer. This is where Bradly's YouTube Downloader comes in and saves the day!

## Installation

Enable Developer Mode in Google Chrome and install the extension, [as described here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

A detailed video is [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRBKYiumhQI) that details error reporting, installation, updating, and a bit of troubleshooting.

* I've since removed the dist folder and you should now use the src folder and use the unpacked files there.
